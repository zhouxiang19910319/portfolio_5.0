## Project Info

* This is my personal portfolio where I showcased some of the projects I have been doing. (frontend only)
* I built this site using these technologies: 
  * HTML CSS Javascript
  * CSS Grid
  * Flexbox
  * **No jQuery, No bootstrap**
* The **only** libraries I utilized was [normailze.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) as well as [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) .
* Everything from the design and the code was done by me.

## Project Highlights 

* Using `@font-face` to display custom fonts `Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro` on my site.
* Fully responsive, whether on mobile or desktop.



## Challenges I run into when building this site 

* Making an image slider using vanilla Javascript , and makes sure it is responsive...
* Making the whole site responsive.
* How to handle two column design.
